In this project we take a look at TMDb which contains data regarding nearly 10,000 movies from 1960's up until 2010's.
This dataset contains alot of useful information including but not limited to genre, user ratings and revenue, and by analzing all of this information we are going to able to find relationships between them and aquire an an insight for what dectates a successful movie.Â¶
We will mainly look into these following questions:

    How did different genres develop over the years regarding popularity?
    What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
